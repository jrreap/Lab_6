## Crash course on Git in Android Studio

First make a github account, you'll need it to use git here

### Clone the Repo

1) In Android studio select the `File` tab in the top left
2) Select `Project from Version Control` and select the `Git` option
3) In the URL section put in this url: `https://github.com/jrreap/Lab_6.git`
4) Then select `Clone`
5) You should now have the full repository cloned. Run a few of the tests to make sure everything is working

### Commit/Push/Pull

In the bottom left corner there should now be a new tab labled `Version Control`. You can open it quickly by pressing `Alt` and `9`

Here you can see any files that you have changed. You can commit them with the green check mark on the left side panel.
There is a section to put in a commit message and it shows all the files you are ready to commit. Additionally you can fill out the `Author` section so that we know who's who.
